List Manipulation: Exercises cover the use of list methods such as reverse(), append(), pop(), remove(), insert(), count(), and index().
Mutability: The document asks about the difference between mutable (lists) and immutable (tuples) data types, and how methods change them .
Accessors vs. Mutators: Questions require identifying whether specific methods are accessors (read-only) or mutators (changers).
List Comprehensions and Loops: There are tasks involving writing for loops to iterate over lists and creating lists using list comprehensions .
Tuple Operations: Exercises include creating, unpacking, indexing, and iterating over tuples, as well as the unique syntax for a single-element tuple.
Heterogeneous vs. Homogeneous: The final questions prompt the user to define "heterogeneous" in the context of tuples and the sister phrase for lists (homogeneous). 



KEY POINTS:

Mutability Distinction: The core concept is that Python lists are mutable (changeable after creation), while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
Syntax: Lists are defined using square brackets [] and tuples use parentheses (). A single-element tuple requires a trailing comma, e.g., (1,).
List Methods: The exercises utilize methods that modify lists in-place (mutator methods), such as append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), reverse(), and sort().
Tuple Methods: Because tuples are immutable, they have fewer methods; the exercises focus on accessor methods that return information without changing the tuple, such as count() and index().
Accessors vs. Mutators: An accessor method reads a value (e.g., index()), while a mutator method changes the data structure (e.g., append()).
Iteration and Comprehension: Both lists and tuples can be iterated over using for loops, and lists can be generated concisely using list comprehensions.
