Sets as Unordered Collections: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements; they do not support indexing or slicing because items have no fixed position.
Set Mutability: Regular sets (set()) are mutable data types, allowing elements to be added or removed (p. 2). A frozenset() is an immutable version .
Set Operations: Mathematical set operations covered include the & operator for intersection and the pipe | for union .
Set Comprehensions: Sets can be programmatically populated using comprehension syntax .
Dictionaries as Key-Value Pairs: Dictionaries store data as a mapping of unique keys to values, referred to as key-value pairs .
Dictionary Properties: Dictionaries are mutable, but their keys must be of an immutable type. Values do not need to be unique.
Accessing and Iterating Dictionaries: Values are accessed using square brackets with the corresponding key (e.g., stock["banana"]). Iteration can occur over keys or values using for loops.




KEY POINTS:

Sets as Unordered Collections: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, which means they do not support indexing or slicing because items have no fixed position .
Set Mutability: Regular sets (set()) are mutable data types, allowing elements to be added or removed. A frozenset() is an immutable version that can be used where unchangeable data is required, such as in another set or as a dictionary key.
Set Operations & Operators: Mathematical set operations use specific operators, such as the & for intersection (common elements) or the pipe | for union (all elements).
Dictionaries as Key-Value Pairs: Dictionaries store data as a mapping of unique keys to values, a pairing often referred to as key-value pairs.
Dictionary Properties: Dictionaries are mutable, but their keys must be of an immutable type (like strings or numbers). Values do not need to be unique.
Accessing and Iterating Dictionaries: Values are accessed using square brackets with the corresponding key (e.g., stock["banana"]). Iteration can be done over.
