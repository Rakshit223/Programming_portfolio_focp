This lecture focused on the fundamental concepts of variables and data types in Python, which are essential for writing meaningful and functional programs. It introduced how Python stores data using variables, how different data types behave, and how user input, functions, and collections such as lists are handled. Through practical exercises, students learned how Python dynamically assigns data types, manipulates values, and processes input and output efficiently. These concepts form the foundation for more advanced programming topics such as control structures, functions, and data structures

KEY TECHNOLOGIES & CONCEPTS LEARNED:

Python Programming Language

Variables and Assignment

Primitive Data Types (int, float, string, boolean)

Dynamic Typing

Built-in Functions (print(), input(), type(), max(), len())

Augmented Assignment Operators (+=, *=)

String Handling and Escape Sequences

Lists and Mutability

Indexing and Slicing

User Input and Output

Type Conversion and Expressions




KEY NOTES:

A variable is used to store data values that can change during program execution.

Python uses dynamic typing, meaning the data type is determined at runtime based on the assigned value.

Common data types include:

Integer (int) – whole numbers

Float (float) – decimal numbers

String (str) – text data

Boolean (bool) – True or False

The type() function is used to check the data type of a variable.

The input() function always returns user input as a string, requiring type conversion for numerical operations.

Augmented assignment operators simplify updating variable values.

Strings support indexing and slicing, allowing access to specific characters or substrings.

Lists can store multiple values, including mixed data types, and are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed.

Strings are immutable, so they cannot be modified once created.

Built-in functions like max() behave differently depending on data type (e.g., comparing strings lexicographically).

Escape sequences (\n, \", \', \\) and triple-quoted strings help format complex text output.
