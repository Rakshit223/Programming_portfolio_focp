This lecture explains how programs make decisions and repeat actions using control statements in Python. Earlier, programs only ran line by line, but this lecture shows how to add logic to programs. Students learned how to use conditions, loops, and Boolean expressions to control the flow of a program. These concepts help in writing real-world programs that can think, decide, and repeat tasks automatically 

3 Control Statements


K KEY TECHNOLOGIES AND CONCEPTS LEARNED :

Python control statements

Boolean expressions

Relational (comparison) operators

Logical operators (and, or, not)

Decision making using if, elif, else

Ternary operator

Looping using while and for

range() function

Membership testing (in, not in)

Loop control statements (break, continue)

Nested loops and nested conditions



KEY NOTES:

Programs work using sequence, selection, and iteration.

Boolean expressions always give True or False.

Comparison operators like <, >, ==, != are used in conditions.

The if statement checks a condition and runs code only if it is true.

else runs when the if condition is false.

elif is used to check multiple conditions.

Logical operators:

and → all conditions must be true

or → at least one condition must be true

not → reverses the result

Python allows chained comparisons, like 10 < x <= 50.

Membership testing checks if a value exists in a list or string.

Non-boolean values can also act as conditions:

0 or empty values → False

Non-zero or non-empty values → True

The ternary operator is a short form of if–else that returns a value.

while loop repeats as long as a condition is true.

for loop repeats over a sequence like a list or range.

range() generates numbers for loops.

break stops a loop immediately.

continue skips the current loop step and moves to the next one.

Loops and if statements can be nested inside each other.
